# PokePoke

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.3.

Imagine you are opening a trendy, new poke eatery in the hippest part of town. Anchored by the work ethic of a rice paddy farmer and topped with raw talent and a generous scoop of optimism, you are ready to revolutionize the Hawaiian classic the way that Chipotle revolutionized the burrito. 

People will line up to try the perfect poke bowl, customized to their individual taste buds using the latest and greatest in deep learning. Just one bite into the fresh locally sourced ingredients will mobilize an entire generation to share their life-changing experience on social media.

Your first task is to implement a scalable, cross-platform ordering experience, aka a website.

You are welcome to reference external documentation, just as any engineer would naturally do while programming.

- The [Angular tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) is a great first step if you do not have previous experience in Angular.

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) is also very helpful in generating new components, etc.
